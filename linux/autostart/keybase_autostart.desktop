# This file is generated the first time Keybase starts, along with a sentinel
# file at ~/.config/keybase/autostart_created. As long as the sentinel exists,
# this file won't be automatically recreated, so you can edit it or delete it
# as you like. Manually changing autostart settings in the GUI can stomp on
# your edits here though.
